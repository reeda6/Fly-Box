## Fly Box

# Overview

Welcome to Fly Box! We are a startup company helping you catch more fish with less work. Fly Box is a social media platform for fisherman that allows users to record their trips and share them with friends.

Users can mark their precise location using GPS coordinate tracking and later see exactly where they were on a Google Map. These position coordinates can be saved for later use or shared with others! Therefore, you and your friends can know exactly where you were when you caught that trophy fish. This will allow you and your friends to find the best spots without having to pay thousands of dollars for a fishing guide... you can become a local. In addition to marking your position, you can add a description and picture of your trip. This can include what the weather was, what flies you used, how high the water was, and of course, your great catch!

Fly Box was started by Alex Reed, a computer science major at Vanderbilt University in June of 2018. Alex always had a passion for fly fishing and saw opportunity for technology to play an even greater role in the fisherman's quest for fish. Alex leveraged Amazon Web Service's Lambda, Cognito, S3, and DynamoDB in addition to Facebook's React to construct this application within a week and a half.

There is great potential for Fly Box to succeed. We hope to scale this application and will implement a strong marketing campaign to spread the word about Fly Box. Additionally, we will later integrate a machine learning platform into our application that will provide location and material recommendations to users.

We hope you enjoy our application and please reach out if you have any comments or concerns!

Good fishing,

The Fly Box Team
